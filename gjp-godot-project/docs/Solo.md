> the game that i'm gonna make at the [[GameJamPlus Recife 2025-10]]

## idea

- enemy that always comes back and evolves
- player has to adapt

> challenge, speedrunning

### elaborate

- enemy is a robot with this evolving AI

when this enemy dies, it comes back stronger
specifically, it will have more weapons, more types of weapons, more defense, more mobility

- player is. a clone.
- a clone also made to adapt
- so everytime player dies, there is this reason

the robot enemy has the one directive: kill you
you have a better directive: live
player has to defeat the robot enough
and then escape this weird situation

### Artsy

- quirky ASCII art. simple, symbolic
- triad CMYK saturated colors
- bit crunched sfx and songs

## Day 1:

![[game day 1.png]]

> alright, i got some stuff i wanted to do, but i didn't commit 100% to it because currently i am still stuck at the other team

commited 99% by sleezily saying out loud to people around them that i was doing the solo project. anyway, who cares! 

what i got done:

- the aesthetics are NICE. and FROM THE GET GO. i may love minimalist art a little bit
	- ascii stuff with the color scheeme was perfect from the beggining. love
- one weapon, a pistol
- enemy with procedural walking feet
- picking up objects (weapons)
